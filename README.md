# generative-adversarial-neural-network

A simple implementation of a Generative Adversarial Neural Network (GANs) for generating numbers using the MINST dataset.

The GANs are well-known neural network architecture for image generation. The basic idea behind GANS is to set 2 Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to fight each other. The first one is the Discriminator, which has as its main goal to distinguish whether a certain image came from our dataset or is generated by the Generator. The second model, the generator, as the name suggests, is responsible for generating the desired image based on a noisy image or the previous iteration image. Therefore, the role of the generator is to fool the discriminator by providing a very similar image.

The GANs are really interesting ANN architecture. However, its training may be hard as GANs are unstable, leading easily to gradient vanishing.
